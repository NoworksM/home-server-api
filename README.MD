# Home Server API
Home server api is a project designed to function as a data repository for IoT devices.
  
The initial reason for creating this is to have a server that can serve as an endpoint for small custom IoT devices to
log data to. My personal use case for this is several small Raspberry Pi Zero devices with temperature and humidity
sensors attached to them to report back so that I can see the temp and humidity in different points of my house.
